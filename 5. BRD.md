# Business Requirements Document (BRD)
**Project Title:** Optimizing Checkout Experience for E-Commerce Retail Store

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This project aims to optimize the checkout process for an e-commerce retail platform. Currently, a significant number of users abandon their carts during the checkout phase due to factors like complex forms, required account creation, and poor mobile experience. By introducing a simplified, mobile-optimized, and guest-friendly checkout flow, the project will improve user satisfaction and increase conversion rates.

---

## 2. Business Objectives
- Increase successful checkout rate by 20% within 3 months.
- Decrease average checkout time by 30%.
- Improve mobile and desktop user satisfaction (CSAT score > 4.5/5).
- Reduce cart abandonment from 60% to 40%.

---

## 3. Problem Statement
The existing checkout process is overly complicated, requiring account registration and presenting a cluttered interfaceâ€”especially on mobile. These issues result in high drop-off rates. A streamlined, guest-friendly solution is needed to enhance the user experience and recover lost sales.
