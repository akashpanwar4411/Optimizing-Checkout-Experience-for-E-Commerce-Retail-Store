# Elicitation Phase Deliverables â€“ Optimizing Checkout Experience

## 1. Elicitation Notes

**Objective:**  
To gather detailed insights from stakeholders regarding current pain points and desired improvements in the checkout process.

**Elicitation Methods Used:**
- One-on-one interviews with Product Owner and UX Lead
- Observation of user sessions and customer support logs
- Surveys sent to recent users who abandoned carts
- Review of analytics tools (e.g., Hotjar, Google Analytics)

**Key Observations:**
- Users abandon checkout when asked to create an account (friction)
- Lack of guest checkout is a major barrier
- Mobile form fields are difficult to navigate
- Long loading times between checkout steps
- Limited payment options, especially mobile wallets
