# Project: Optimizing Checkout Experience for E-Commerce Retail Store

## ðŸ›’ Business Case: Optimizing Checkout Experience for E-commerce Retail Store

### 1. Executive Summary
This business case proposes the optimization of the checkout experience on our e-commerce platform. The current multi-step checkout process is lengthy and causes high cart abandonment rates. By simplifying and streamlining the user flow, we aim to reduce friction, improve customer satisfaction, and increase conversion rates.

### 2. Business Problem
The current checkout process involves multiple steps (cart â†’ login â†’ shipping â†’ billing â†’ payment), which leads to:
- 30â€“40% cart abandonment at the checkout stage  
- Repeated customer complaints regarding confusion and time taken  
- High bounce rates from mobile users due to poor UI and performance  

This directly affects revenue, customer retention, and operational efficiency.

### 3. Proposed Solution
Renovate the checkout flow into a **streamlined, mobile-first, single-page or 2-step process**. Features will include:
- Guest checkout option  
- Auto-fill and address suggestion features  
- Real-time cart summary on the same page  
- Multiple payment options with saved preferences  
- Mobile UI optimization  

### 4. Success Criteria
- Reduce checkout time from 3+ minutes to under 1 minute  
- Increase checkout conversion rate by 20%  
- Reduce cart abandonment by 25%  
- Improve mobile user satisfaction scores by 30%
