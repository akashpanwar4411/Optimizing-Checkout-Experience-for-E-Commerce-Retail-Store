|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stakeholder unavailability | Plan sessions in advance and record discussions                     |
| Unclear requirements       | Use wireframes, examples to clarify during elicitation               |
| Scope creep                | Formal scope sign-off and change control log                         |
| Technical limitations      | Involve developers during early discovery                            |
